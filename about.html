  <p>I'm an academic researcher and programmer who brings his interpretive and technical know-how to compelling human problems.<p>
  <p>At the moment I'm completing my PhD at the University of Chicago's <a href="https://socialthought.uchicago.edu/">Committee on Social Thought</a>, where I'm finishing a dissertation about individualism in modern Western societies.</p>
  <p>While I have always been a big believer in the humanistic tradition (philosophy, literature, history, etc.) and what it has to teach us about the world, I am also quite fascinated by how science and technology are transforming everyday life.  In practical terms, this means that I am a pretty big tech geek who has spent significant time and effort building his coding skills!</p>
  <p>On this front, I have a number of technical skills and interests.  These include web programming, data analytics, machine learning, data mining, and network security.  My languages of choice include Python, Javascript, Ruby and C/C++.<p>
