  <p>I'm an academic researcher and programmer who brings his interpretive and
  technical know-how to compelling human problems.</p>
  <p>I'm finishing up my PhD at the University of Chicago's <a
	  href="https://socialthought.uchicago.edu/">Committee on Social
	  Thought</a>, where I wrote a dissertation about individualism in modern
  Western culture.</p>
  <p>
  Besides my recent dissertation work, I have an active and growing
  portfolio of skills and projects related to web tech, data analytics, and
  working with digital content. Before getting my PhD, I worked at the <a
   href="https://www.newamerica.org/" target="_blank">New
   America Foundation</a>, where I designed and helped implement <a
									  href="http://www.stimulus.org"
		   target="_blank">stimulus.org</a> (now
  archived), a nationally-recognized online database for journalists and policymakers
  to help track federal government actions related to the 2009
  financial crisis. I was also previously an analyst doing best-practices
  research on medical technology trends for the <a
	 href="https://www.advisory.com/" target="_blank">Advisory Board Company</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  I view my research and technical interests as complementary skill sets. Both
  require insatiable curiosity and a good instinct for staying on top of new
  trends. As a writer, my work has often focused on how science and technology are
  transforming everyday life. As a tech geek, I have spent significant time and
  effort building coding skills that can be applied to real-world problems! At
  the conclusion of my Ph.D., I intend to move into the private sector and
  pursue a career in technology full time.

  professional interests.
  </p> 
  <p> 
  Outside of work, I am an accomplished amateur runner who has competed in
  distances from 5k to ultra-marathon. I'm also a dedicated backpacker and
  outdoorsman with dozens of trips logged across North America in all four
  seasons, and an avid fly-fisher and fly-tyer.
